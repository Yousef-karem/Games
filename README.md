# Tik-Tak-Toe
some board games to play by two players or with the pc and this have a feature to play against AI player.
at the first I developed the games with c++ langue to Play it with letter 'X' and 'O' in the terminal but to make it more intersted I made it GUi with framework QT widget.
after this I developed the random player to play as AI player with algorithm Min-Max.
1- Four-in-a-row
  You will recognize four-in-a row as a two-dimensional version of the classic game, Connect Four. The game board consists of a 7 x 6 grid. Seven columns of six squares each. Instead of dropping counters as in Connect Four, players mark the grid with Xs and Os as in tic-tac-toe.
  Rules: The first player places an X in the bottom square of any column. Taking turns, players make their mark in any column, as long as it is in the lowest square possible. See image below for an example of possible first six moves.
  Winning: The first player to get four-in-a-row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

2- Pyramic Tic-Tac-Toe
  The game board is shaped like a pyramid. Five squares make the base, then three, then one. Players take turns marking Xs and Os as in traditional tic-tac-toe.
  Winning: The first player to get three-in-a-row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins. See two examples of winning positions, below.

3- 5 x 5 Tic Tac Toe 
  This tic-tac-toe variation is played on a 5 x 5 grid. As in the traditional game, players are Xs or Os.
  Rules: Players take turns placing an X or an O in one of the squares until all the squares except one are filled. (Each player has 12 turns for a total of 24 squares.) 
  Winning: Count the number of three-in-a-rows each player has. Sequences can be vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Whoever has the most, wins. Can one mark be counted in more than one three-in-a-row sequence? Decide ahead of time, yes or no. It is easier in implementation to allow counting more than once. 
  Group Task 3 (1 mark) – OOP System Integration    
  The team will integrate their work and deliver an app that gives a menu of choices with the games available and if the user chooses a game, it opens the board for him to play against another player or a random computer player. 
  Group Task 4 (1 mark) – Code Review and Code Quality    
  Code review is an essential part of software development to ensure its quality and readability and reduce the bugs. Each team member will read the code of the other members and produce a report about it. Develop a suitable code review process that involves.
